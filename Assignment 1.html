			<h1>What exactly are Black holes?</h1>
		</header>
		<main>Black holes are astronomical objects with gravitational forces so unbelievably strong that Light can't escape them. 
		These Daunting elements of Space are born when a star collapses under its own weight. 
		This cave-in, if you will, would cause a Supernova explosion that would shoot the star's outer layers off. 
		And if the star core had three times the sun's mass, then it has a very high chance of turning into a black hole. 
		Afterward, the black hole starts pulling nearby matter into it, ranging from stars, gas, planets, and even its own kind if they are small enough.</main>
		<p>The Following are some pictures of Black holes</p>

		<p>This is actually the first picture of a black hole that was taken by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration on April 10, 2019.</p>
		<p>Honestly, this picture reminds me of burned films; it leaves a strange feeling of longing, at least to me. 
		What did this look like before? Are we missing something important? Or is it better that we don't know? Regardless, now we're just left with empty spaces..</p>
