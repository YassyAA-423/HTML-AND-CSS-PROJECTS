		<p>Here's a cool fact A discovery happened in 2015 when scientists first detected gravitational waves, ripples in the fabric of space-time. 
			LIGO detected these waves from an event called GW150914. This event was when two black holes spiraled into each other and joined together over a billion years ago.</p>
		<p>Another cool fact is The nearest black hole is Gaia BH1, which is roughly 1,500 light-years away (8,817,938,059,775,412 Miles or 14,191,095,708,871,200 Kilometers).</p>
		<p>Here is a quote from Nasa Website:</p>
		<blockquote cite="https://www.nasa.gov/universe/what-are-black-holes/">
		The supermassive black hole is located at the heart of a galaxy called M87, located about 55 million light-years away, and weighs more than 6 billion solar masses.
		Its event horizon extends so far it could encompass much of our solar system out to well beyond the planets.
